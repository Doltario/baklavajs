# Node Options

Node Options can be used to give users the ability to change more advanced settings of a node than node interfaces would allow. They can display arbitrary HTML in the form of Vue components.

Every option (the same goes for sidebar options) is just a Vue component. It receives these props:
* **`value`**: `any` The value of the option
* **`name`**: `string` Name of the option
* **`option`**: [`NodeOption`](!!API%{ "module": "@baklavajs/core", "type": "class", "name": "nodeoption" }%) The option instance
* **`node`**: [`Node`](!!API%{ "module": "@baklavajs/core", "type": "class", "name": "node" }%) The node instance. It can be used to call functions in your node model.

Additionally, it can emit these events:
* **`input`**: Update the value
* **`openSidebar`**: Opens the sidebar

The node option's value can be written or read programatically by using the
[setOptionValue](!!API%{ "module": "@baklavajs/core", "type": "class", "name": "node", "field": "setoptionvalue" }%) and
[getOptionValue](!!API%{ "module": "@baklavajs/core", "type": "class", "name": "node", "field": "getoptionvalue" }%) methods.

### Options in the ViewPlugin
When adding an option to a node, you only specify the type of the option as a string. This is done to separate logic and view.
The ViewPlugin then contains the `options` field that maps these strings to actual view components.

To add your custom option to this mapping, use the `registerOption` method:
```js
import MyOption from "MyOption.vue";
viewPlugin.registerOption("MyOption", MyOption);
```

### Sidebar
Some options can require a more complex UI which would not fit in the limited space that a node provides.
In this case, you can display a button in the node that will open the sidebar when pressed.
The advanced UI can now be displayed in the sidebar. To open the sidebar, emit the `openSidebar` event in your option.

> The prebuilt ButtonOption will open the sidebar by default when clicked.
> Use this, if you just want a button in your node that opens the sidebar when clicked.
> (the ButtonOption is part of the [option plugin](/plugins/options.md))

```js
// in the node constructor
this.addOption("SidebarTest", "ButtonOption", () => ({ testtext: "any" }), "MySidebarOption");
```

Both the component in the node as well as the component in the sidebar
will receive the current option value through the `value` prop.

### Prebuilt Options
There are prebuilt options like text and number input, dropdown menu and many more available.
They can be used through the [option plugin](/plugins/options.md).

### Default Values
> When providing complex default values like arrays or objects as default values using the NodeBuilder's
> [addOption](!!API%{ "module": "@baklavajs/core", "type": "class", "name": "nodebuilder", "field": "addoption"}%) method,
> you need to provide a function that returns the default array or object.
> This ensures that multiple instances of the node option all have their own data objects.

Example:
```js
new NodeBuilder("MyNode")
    // This is fine, because we provide a primitive as default value
    .addOption("Primitive", "MyOption", "default")
    // But in this case we need to provide a function to create an object
    .addOption("Complex", "MyOption", () => {
        return { a: 1, b: "Hello World!" };
    })
```

### User Select
By default, all child DOM elements of a `.node` element have `user-select: none;` set. This can lead to issues with text input fields in certain browser, so by default `input` and `textarea` elements are exempt. If you have other elements that you want to be selectable, apply the `.input-user-select` class to them.
